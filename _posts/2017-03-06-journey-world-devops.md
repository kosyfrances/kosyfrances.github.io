_Continuation of [My Journey into the world of Programming](/journey-world-programming)_

About a year ago, sometime in 2016, while working as an entry-level software engineer at [Noodle Education](https://www.noodle.com/home), I got interested in what the guys in the DevOps team were doing and how they were like the 911 of the engineering team. I watched how some developers freaked out when some weird errors appeared on their terminal and how the DevOps guys would put out the fires for them.

I reached out to our VP of Engineering, asking if I could move to the DevOps department. After persisting for a long time, he agreed to my request.

The world of [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) was a different ball game altogether. I was a newbie all of a sudden with so much to learn and catch up with. The VP of IT who was in charge of the DevOps team gave me a small homework to give me a general idea of the basics of what they do in their team. It was a very helpful starting point. Afterwards, I was given a task to write a script to generate SQL queries from a data file using python. I felt fulfilled when I finished the task with the help of my team-mate in the DevOps team and watched the script generate SQL queries. _Gosh! The joy of automation._

Few months after, I participated in the DevOps pilot training at [Andela](https://andela.com/). A lot of things that had previously seemed strange began to make sense to me. It was a challenging time and there were times when I asked myself who sent me to become a DevOps Engineer, but my facilitator was always encouraging me and my team-mates, giving us the “_I can do it_” attitude.

After the DevOps pilot training, I worked for a few months at The Zebra as an entry level DevOps Engineer. Here I got introduced to handling a lot more servers and an arsenal of new tools I had never worked with, coupled with the fact that there was a lot going on that I needed to get a grasp of. It was overwhelming as I felt like I was being thrown into the ocean but thankfully, my team-mate was always patient to answer the million and one questions I had and putting me through whenever I was stuck and confused.

DevOps is an interesting field with so much to explore and learn. But there are still days when I encounter some kind of challenges and ask myself this same question again _“Who asked me to become a DevOps Engineer?”_

Thank you, Ralph Lepore, for letting me join the DevOps team in the first place.

Thank you, [Darwin Abella](https://medium.com/@darwinabella), [Remi Taffin](https://medium.com/@remitaffin), [Afolabi Badmos](https://medium.com/@badie) and Jim Howell for patiently mentoring me and helping me grow.
